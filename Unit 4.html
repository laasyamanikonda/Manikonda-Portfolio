<h3>What Is This?
</h3>
  <h4>This project is essentially an informational, and somewhat interactive, slideshow, which teaches the user how global warming affects our world, and what we can do to reduce its effects. 
</h4>
  <h3>What Did I Learn? What Does It Show? </h3>
  <h4>
    This was one of my favorite projects because I was able to work with someone I knew well and collaborate efficiently, and was able to explore the content. It was really fun, as well as educational, to research how to improve the environment and be able to represent it visually. I believe it helped my partner and me determine how to use concepts, such as onKeyPress, groups, etc. and actually implement them. It helped me reconcile understanding something conceptually vs. in practicality.

  <h3>How was it created</h3>
  <h4>Many factors, such as groups, onKeyPress, contains, etc. helped me create this project.
