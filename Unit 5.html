  <h3>What Is This?
</h3>
  <h4>This project, similar to Unit 4, is an informational and interactive slideshow about reading. It contains information and guidance about why people should read, how to pick a good book, where/where not to look for recommendations, etc. 
</h4>
  <h3>What Did I Learn? What Does It Show? </h3>
  <h4>
    For this project, we were given the option to choose what kind of project we wanted to do, which was a great opportunity for me to explore my creativity, as well as figure out how to incorporate CS concepts. I love both CS & reading, so I was able to bring together 2 of my passions in this project. This motivated me to formulate a great project, and was probably my best unit project.

  </h4>
  <h3>How was it created</h3>
  <h4>This project was created through several conditionals, onKeyPress, onKeyHold, etc. onMousePress was also essential to switch through pages, as well as groups, which made switching through pages incredibly efficient. Specifically, I used onKeyPress to create a label everytime a key is pressed.
