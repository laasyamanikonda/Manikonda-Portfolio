  <h3>What Is This?
</h3>
  <h4>A one-page graphic showcasing the global scholar graphic, 4 different global goals, and ways we would visually represent them.
</h4>
  <h3>What Did I Learn? What Does It Show? </h3>
  <h4>
    It was a great introduction to the class and really taught me the foundations and principles of coding, as well as made me more comfortable with CMU and Python as a whole. It was a strong start to the class, and I enjoyed this unit.

  </h4>
  <h3>How was it created</h3>
  <h4>Using many shapes, shape properties, colors, fonts, etc. It was a great experimentation project, as we had only been working with ‘restricted’ exercises up until that point. It was interesting to use
    what I had learned in those, and apply them to this project by creating cool shapes and objects. For example, the pie lines and pie filling were put there to create a more fleshed out shape/visual effect when users looked at the pie.
