  <h3>What Is This?
</h3>
  <h4>This project is an informational slideshow about clean water and sanitation, and educates users about problems, impacts of the problems, solutions, etc. 
</h4>
  <h3>What Did I Learn? What Does It Show? </h3>
  <h4>
    We did not incorporate many graphics into this project, but we thoroughly researched our project and I felt very educated and comfortable speaking about clean water and sanitation during this project. We had two functions, one for each “logo”, and we ensured that the logo, in some way, was present on every slide. This taught me how to customize functions using parameters, which really helped me.


  </h4>
  <h3>How was it created</h3>
  <h4>We used functions for logos, page functions, and onMousePress; we were able to create the whole project with these things! We also used many labels, and experimented with fonts. Specifically, the function
    for the water glass was difficult, as I had to ensure the correct
    opacity, and it was made fully with polygons. After I defined
    the function, however, it was easy to create the rest of the project.
